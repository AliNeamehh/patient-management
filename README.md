# üè• Patient Management Microservices System

This project implements a full **Spring Boot Microservices Architecture** that simulates a real-world patient management and healthcare billing system. It includes modular services with modern features such as **gRPC**, **Kafka**, **JWT Authentication**, **Dockerized Deployment**, and **Cloud Infrastructure** with **AWS CloudFormation**.

---

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot 3** (REST APIs, Controllers, Services)
- **gRPC** (Service-to-service communication)
- **Kafka** (Event-driven architecture)
- **Spring Security + JWT** (Authentication & Authorization)
- **Docker + Docker Compose**
- **CloudFormation (IaC)** for provisioning AWS services
- **LocalStack** for local AWS simulation
- **JUnit** + **TestContainers** for integration testing
- **OpenAPI (Swagger)** for API documentation

|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `patient-service`| CRUD for patients, validation, JWT-secured endpoints, Kafka producer, gRPC  |
| `billing-service`| gRPC server for billing integration                                         |
| `analytics-service`| Kafka consumer for analytics on patient events                          |
| `auth-service`   | Handles user login, JWT generation and validation                           |
